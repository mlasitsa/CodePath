# Web Development Final Project - Postify

Submitted by: **Max Lasitsa**

This web app: **Postify is a full-stack social posting platform where users can create, edit, delete, comment on, and upvote posts. It includes search, sort, and detailed post views â€” all managed through a clean, responsive UI and a single Supabase-backed `posts` table.**

Time spent: **10 hours spent in total**

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Web app includes a create form that allows the user to create posts**
  - Form requires users to add a post title
  - Forms have the *option* for users to add: 
    - additional textual content
    - an image added as an external image URL
- [x] **Web app includes a home feed displaying previously created posts**
  - Web app includes home feed displaying previously created posts
  - Each post on the posts feed shows:
    - creation time
    - title 
    - upvotes count
  - Clicking on a post directs the user to a new page for the selected post
- [x] **Users can view posts in different ways**
  - Users can sort posts by either:
    - creation time
    - upvotes count
  - Users can search for posts by title
- [x] **Users can interact with each post in different ways**
  - Each post has its own detail page showing:
    - content
    - image
    - comments
  - Users can leave comments on a post
  - Each post includes an upvote button:
    - Each click increases the post's upvotes count by one
    - Users can upvote any post any number of times
- [x] **A post that a user previously created can be edited or deleted from its post page**
  - After a user creates a new post, they can edit it
  - A post can be deleted from its post page

## Optional Features

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Web app implements pseudo-authentication
  - Upon launching the app, the user must enter a username which is saved in `localStorage`
  - Only the original post creator (by username match) can edit or delete a post

## Additional Features

- [x] Comments are stored inside the `posts` table directly using a JSON array
- [x] Minimal, clean inline styling for an accessible and elegant layout
- [x] Fully RESTful API built with Express.js and Supabase
- [x] Post upvotes and comment submissions update live without reloading
- [x] Upvote count displayed on both list and detail pages
- [x] Reusable frontend components for layout and forms


## Notes

Some challenges encountered:
- Implementing comment storage directly within the `posts` table while keeping frontend logic clean
- Ensuring post editing and deletion was secure and tied to the correct pseudo-authenticated user
- Avoiding extra complexity like databases for users or separate comment tables while preserving full functionality
