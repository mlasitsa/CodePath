# Web Development Project 5 - **Brewery Explorer**

Submitted by: **Max Lasitsa**

This web app: **lets users browse breweries across the U.S., search by name, filter by brewery type, and save favorites to a personalized list.**

Time spent: **6â€“8 hours in total**

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

  - The dashboard displays at least 10 unique breweries, each with a name and type
  - Each row includes a favorite toggle and brewery location info

- [X] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data**
  - Total number of filtered breweries
  - Average name length of visible breweries
  - Number of unique U.S. states represented in the list

- [X] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar filters breweries by name (case-insensitive)
  - Results dynamically update while the user types

  - The filter dropdown filters breweries by their `brewery_type`

## Notes

Some challenges included:

- Had to turn off run time validation on Zod since it was causing some error
